# Movie Watchlist Project - CS 3620

A simple web application where users can create an account to browse a assortment of movies and TV shows. Users can add items to their personal watchlist, rate what they've seen, and get simple analytical insights. The application's content is built by combining a comprehensive movie dataset (TMDB), a TV show dataset (Netflix), and is enriched with historical film awards data (Oscars).
